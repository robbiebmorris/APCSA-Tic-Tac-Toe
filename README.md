# APCSA-Tic-Tac-Toe

NOTE: I didn't know that in github, when you rename files it removes their entire history. 
Throughout this project, 2 out of the 4 main files I believe have been renamed. This means that the history
makes very little sense. I wish I had known this before changing the files, but it is too late.
Originally, there were 6 files / classes, with one for normal AI, one for advanced AI, one called "play" (a early idea of
a gui class), and then the others that currently exist. There is no record of these, but I wanted to document that they existed.
The minimax file also lost all of it's history, which is very disapointing because I had like at least 15 commints on that thing. 
But I changed the file name so it's all gone.
